# 🎵 Auris — Emotion-Aware Music Recommender

## Introduction
Auris is an AI-powered music recommendation system designed to understand human emotions and suggest songs that align with the user’s current mood. By analyzing lyrical content and emotional context, Auris goes beyond traditional genre-based recommendations to deliver a more personalized listening experience.

---

## Problem Statement
Most music recommendation platforms rely heavily on listening history, popularity, or genre classification. These approaches often fail to capture the listener’s emotional state, which plays a crucial role in music preference at any given moment.

---

## Solution Overview
Auris addresses this limitation by incorporating emotion detection and natural language processing techniques. The system predicts emotions from text input and recommends musically and emotionally similar songs using lyrical analysis and similarity scoring.

---

## Key Features
- Emotion classification across 28 distinct emotional categories  
- Emotion-aware music recommendation  
- Lyric-based similarity ranking  
- Artist diversity filtering to avoid repetition  
- Integrated YouTube playback support  
- Fast and interactive frontend interface  

---

## Technologies Used

### Machine Learning & NLP
- Random Forest Classifier  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Cosine Similarity  

### Backend
- Python  
- Flask  

### Frontend
- React  
- Vite  

### Datasets & APIs
- GoEmotions dataset  
- Spotify lyrics dataset  
- YouTube integration  

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with a Flask backend responsible for emotion detection, recommendation logic, and data processing.

---

## Workflow
1. User provides mood or text input  
2. Text is preprocessed and vectorized using TF-IDF  
3. Emotion is predicted using a trained Random Forest model  
4. Songs matching the emotion are filtered  
5. Similarity scores rank the recommendations  
6. Results are displayed with playback options

## Model Description

### Dataset
- GoEmotions dataset for emotion classification  
- Spotify lyrics dataset for recommendation  

### Preprocessing
- Text cleaning  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  

### Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF feature extraction  

### Model Training
- Supervised training using Random Forest  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Emotion-wise performance analysis  

---

## Recommendation Logic
Recommendations are generated by combining predicted emotional labels with cosine similarity scores computed from TF-IDF vectors of song lyrics.
